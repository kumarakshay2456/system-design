# 🔄 Kafka vs RabbitMQ vs Redis – Real-World Scenarios

## ✅ Scenario 1: Food Delivery App (like Swiggy/Zomato)

### 🌟 Use Case:
- Customer places an order.
- Notify restaurant, update delivery, send confirmation, retry on failure.

---

### 🐇 Using RabbitMQ

#### Why RabbitMQ is Best:
1. **Order Confirmation + Restaurant Notification**
   - Queued in `order_events` queue.
   - Retry support (DLQ), message durability.

2. **Push/Email Notifications**
   - Consumers read from `notifications_queue`.
   - Built-in retry and ack support.

3. **Delivery Assignment**
   - Messages routed by **exchange types** (topic-based regions).

✅ **Why RabbitMQ**: Ideal for **task queues**, **routing**, and **retry logic**.

---

### 🦄 Using Kafka

- Better for analytics or event sourcing.
- High throughput, supports event replay.

⚠️ Too heavy for simple order processing unless **streaming analytics** are needed.

---

### 🟥 Using Redis

- Fast but **not durable**.
- Use for ephemeral data like **delivery location** updates to frontend.

### ✅ Final Tech Stack (Scenario 1)

| Component                          | Pick         | Reason                                  |
|-----------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Order handling and retries        | RabbitMQ     | Task processing, acks, retries          |
| Delivery partner location updates | Redis        | Fast, low-latency, ephemeral            |
| Analytics on order events         | Kafka (opt)  | Real-time dashboards, stream processing |

---

## ✅ Scenario 2: Real-Time Analytics System (e.g., Uber Heatmap)

### 🌟 Use Case:
- Millions of driver/location/stock events per second.
- Update dashboards, process events, allow replay.

---

### 🦄 Using Kafka

#### Why Kafka is Best:
1. **High Throughput**
   - Can ingest millions of events per second.

2. **Real-Time Dashboards**
   - Integrates with Spark/Flink.

3. **Replay & Persistence**
   - Re-process events on crash or error.

4. **Multiple Independent Consumers**
   - One for heatmaps, another for reports, etc.

✅ **Why Kafka**: Ideal for **event streams**, **real-time processing**, **scalability**.

---

### 🐇 Using RabbitMQ

- Not great for streaming.
- No replay or persistence.

❌ Use only for background jobs or alerts.

---

### 🟥 Using Redis

- Best for **low-latency UI updates** (e.g., last known driver location).
- Use as in-memory store or pub/sub.

### ✅ Final Tech Stack (Scenario 2)

| Component                         | Pick         | Reason                                     |
|----------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Real-time event ingestion        | Kafka        | Streaming, analytics, replayable           |
| Driver location storage          | Redis        | Ephemeral, fast, real-time UI              |
| Complex task workflows (if any)  | RabbitMQ (opt)| For alerts or delayed background tasks     |

| Use Case                        | Kafka                | RabbitMQ                  | Redis                     |
|--------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Order processing (Swiggy)      | ❌ Too complex       | ✅ Best fit (retries, routing) | ⚠️ Only for temp data     |
| Real-time analytics (Uber)     | ✅ Perfect           | ❌ Not built for scale     | ✅ Best for fast ephemeral |
