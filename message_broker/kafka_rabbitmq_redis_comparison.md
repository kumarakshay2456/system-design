| Type               | Distributed Log / Stream                    | Message Broker / Queue           | In-Memory Data Structure / Stream |
| Protocol           | Kafka Protocol / TCP                        | AMQP / MQTT / STOMP              | Custom Redis Protocol (RESP)      |
| Message Retention  | Time-based, size-based (default: 7 days)    | Until acknowledged (manual/auto) | Configurable (based on memory)    |
| Message Ordering   | Per partition                               | Per queue                        | Per stream                        |
| Replayability      | ✅ Yes (seek to offset)                      | ❌ No (unless requeue manually)   | ✅ Yes (via stream ID)             |
| Persistence        | ✅ Durable                                   | ✅ Durable                        | ✅ Durable (with AOF/RDB)          |
| Scale Horizontally | ✅ Native Partitioning                       | ⚠️ Requires Sharding Plugins     | ⚠️ Via Redis Cluster              |
| Performance        | High throughput (100K+ msg/s)               | Moderate (1K–10K msg/s)          | Very fast (low-latency in-memory) |
| Use Cases          | Real-time stream processing, analytics, ETL | Background tasks, RPC, pub/sub   | Lightweight queuing, fast caching |
| Complexity         | High (Zookeeper/KRaft setup)                | Medium                           | Low                               |
| Delayed Messaging  | ✅ With Kafka Streams / 3rd party            | ✅ Native TTL plugin              | ✅ Via sorted sets or streams      |
| Language Support   | Wide (Java, Python, Go, etc.)               | Wide                             | Wide                              |

## ✅ Use Case Recommendations

| Scenario                                  | Recommended Tool | Reason |
|-------------------------------------------|------------------|--------|
| Event sourcing and audit logs             | Kafka            | Supports replay and long-term retention |
| Asynchronous task queue for microservices | RabbitMQ         | Simple ack/Nack, retry, fanout |
| Real-time analytics dashboard             | Kafka            | High throughput, partitioned topics |
| Lightweight job queue                     | Redis            | Low-latency, simple to implement |
| Real-time chat or notification system     | Redis Streams    | Sub-millisecond latency |
| ETL pipelines                              | Kafka            | Kafka Connect ecosystem |
| RPC between services                      | RabbitMQ         | Native support with routing keys |
| Scheduled/delayed tasks                   | RabbitMQ / Redis | TTL queues or sorted sets |
| IoT message ingestion                     | Kafka            | Scalability and persistence |
| Serverless function queues                | Redis            | Stateless, fast, ephemeral |

## 📘 Real-Time Examples

### Kafka Example: Streaming Order System
- Topic: `orders`
- Producers: Mobile App, Web App
- Consumers: Inventory Service, Billing Service, Notification Service

Kafka ensures messages are **retained**, **partitioned**, and can be **replayed**.

### RabbitMQ Example: Background Task Queue
- Queue: `image_resize`
- Producer: Upload Service
- Consumer: Worker processing thumbnails

RabbitMQ provides **ack/nack**, retries, and **routing** via exchanges.

### Redis Streams Example: Real-time Notification System
- Stream: `notifications`
- Producer: App sends new event messages
- Consumer: WebSocket backend pushes updates

Redis Streams offer **low-latency** and **lightweight** operations.

## 🧠 Choosing the Right Tool

| Question                                       | Consider This |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Do I need message **durability + replay**?     | Kafka         |
| Do I want **easy queueing and routing**?       | RabbitMQ      |
| Do I need **ultra-fast, low-latency** queues?  | Redis         |
| Will I handle **real-time analytics / ETL**?   | Kafka         |
| Do I want to **delay or schedule** messages?   | RabbitMQ / Redis |
| Am I building a **microservices** platform?    | RabbitMQ / Kafka |
