Absolutely! Since you‚Äôre aiming to ace Low-Level Design (LLD) interviews, here are 30+ more advanced and nuanced questions across various themes like real-world extensions, trade-offs, scalability, and design thinking ‚Äî all applicable to systems like BookMyShow or other LLD problems (e.g., elevator system, parking lot, food delivery, etc.).

üß† Advanced LLD Questions ‚Äì BookMyShow & Generalized

üéØ Feature Extensions & Business Requirements

	1.	How would you add a feature to allow users to choose food/snacks while booking a movie?
	Design a FoodMenu, FoodItem, and link to Theatre. Include food_items in the Booking.
	2.	What if a theatre has multiple screens showing the same movie? How do you differentiate shows?
	Include screen_id and start_time in Show for disambiguation.
	3.	How would you support seat types like Recliner, VIP, Economy?
	Add a SeatType enum and associate pricing and features accordingly.
	4.	How would you implement coupons and promo codes?
	Design Coupon entity with fields like validity, discount_type, and apply in Booking.
	5.	How to implement a loyalty program or membership system?
	Introduce User entity with a points field. Track rewards and redemptions per booking.

üîÄ Concurrency & Consistency

	6.	How do you prevent double booking of seats at scale?
	Use database-level locks, Redis-based distributed locks, or a queue-based booking system.
	7.	What happens if a server crashes during booking or payment?
	Use transactional mechanisms and mark seats as ‚Äútentatively booked‚Äù. Auto-release after timeout.
	8.	How would you handle atomicity between booking and payment operations?
	Use Saga pattern or two-phase commit across Booking and Payment.

üõ£Ô∏è Scalability & Distributed Systems

	9.	How would you horizontally scale this system across multiple data centers?
	Use region-based sharding. Route requests based on user city/region.
	10.	How would you cache the most popular movies or showtimes?

	Use Redis or CDN, invalidate cache when showtime ends or seat status changes.

	11.	How would you design a system where millions of users book during a blockbuster movie release?

	Apply rate limiting, use async booking queues, and add backpressure mechanisms.

üì∂ Availability & Fault Tolerance

	12.	How would you make the system resilient to third-party payment service downtime?

	Retry with exponential backoff, fallback to alternate payment gateways, or queue failed attempts.

	13.	What if the seat availability data in cache becomes stale?

	Use write-through or write-around caching strategies and version checks.

üß© Design Thinking & Trade-offs

	14.	Would you use SQL or NoSQL for this system and why?

	SQL for transactions and relational consistency (RDBMS), NoSQL for high-speed reads (e.g., show listings, cities).

	15.	Would you denormalize seat data in Show or keep it normalized?

	Denormalize only if performance becomes an issue, with careful versioning and update strategies.

	16.	How would you support complex seat layouts (curved theatres, balcony)?

	Use a SeatLayout service storing row/column info and coordinate positions.

üßæ APIs & Contracts

	17.	How do you version your APIs to support backward compatibility?

	Add /v1, /v2 in the API path or use request headers for versioning.

	18.	What status codes do you return for payment failure vs booking conflict?

	409 Conflict (seat already booked), 402 Payment Required, 400 Bad Request (invalid seat).

	19.	How would you make your API idempotent for payment retries?

	Accept a transaction_id and store request hash to detect duplicates.

üë• User Management & Analytics

	20.	How would you support guest vs registered users in booking flow?

	Bookings can be made with email/mobile. Optional user linkage post-payment.

	21.	How would you capture user preferences for personalized movie recommendations?

	Track clicks/views, use collaborative filtering, store preferences in user profile.

	22.	How do you log user behavior for analytics?

	Use event logging systems (e.g., Kafka, Google Pub/Sub), and ELK stack for querying.

üß™ Testing & Observability

	23.	How do you write unit tests for booking logic?

	Mock Show and Seat objects, test availability, state transitions, and invalid seat selection.

	24.	How would you test for race conditions in seat booking?

	Use multi-threaded unit/integration tests with artificial delays.

	25.	How would you monitor real-time booking failures?

	Emit metrics to Prometheus/Grafana. Set up alerts on booking failure rates.

üåê Geo-based and Regional Features

	26.	How would you support region-specific regulations like tax differences per state?

	Include a tax_policy in Theatre or City and compute final price during booking.

	27.	How would you support show recommendations based on geography?

	Use location-based filtering or IP geo-resolution to recommend nearest theatres.

üîÑ Integration with External Services

	28.	How would you integrate SMS/email notifications after booking?

	Use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) and send via async workers.

	29.	How would you handle failures in downstream services (e.g., food delivery, seat maps)?

	Implement retry logic, fallbacks, and service circuit breakers (e.g., Netflix Hystrix).

üí° Miscellaneous & Hypothetical

	30.	How would you design for international expansion (e.g., different currencies, languages)?

	Add i18n support for text, currency formatting, timezone adjustments.

	31.	What if a user wants to reschedule a booking?

	Introduce reschedule API that cancels old booking, checks availability, and creates new one.

	32.	How would you ensure data consistency if the booking service goes down during a showtime update?

	Use distributed transactions or eventual consistency with reconciliation scripts.

üîö Bonus: Behavioral/System Design Questions

	33.	Tell me about a trade-off you had to make in your LLD design.
	34.	How would you prioritize between performance and correctness for booking?
	35.	If you had to refactor this code for microservices, where would you draw the boundaries?
